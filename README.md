# DijkstraVisualization
-----------------------

The first iteration of this android app will allow the creation and display of graphs.

Once this has been completed various graph algorithms will be demostrated upon these graphs.

The first such algorithm will be dijkstras.  The goal is to be able to modify the graph and watch it change in real time.
I may later decide to add a mode in which the algorithm will be animated.
